# Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Miniconda** (for managing the Python environment)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. **Set Up the Python Environment**
   - Create the environment using the `environment.yml` file:
     ```bash
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     conda activate your_environment_name  # Replace with the environment name specified in environment.yml
     ```

#### 3. **Configure Database Connection Strings**
   - **Fill the `.env` File**:
     - Copy and rename the `template.env` file to `.env`:
       ```bash
       cp template.env .env
       ```
     - Edit the `.env` file to include your database connection string. It should look something like this:
       ```
        DB_HOST = ''
        DB_PORT = ''
        DB_DATABASE_PROD = ''
        DB_DATABASE_DEV = ''
        DB_USER = ''
        DB_PASSWORD = ''
        ```

   - **Update `populate_table.py`**:
     - Open `populate_table.py` and update lines 15 and 21 with your database connection string. It should look something like this:
       ```python
        db_params = {
        'dbname': '',
        'user': '',
        'password': '',
        'host': '',
        'port': ''
        }
       ```

#### 4. **Set Up the Database**
   - Navigate to the `setup` folder:
     ```bash
     cd setup
     ```

   - Run the SQL scripts to create the tables:
     ```bash
     psql -U your_db_user -d your_db_name -f create_table/create_table.sql
     ```

   - Run the Python scripts to set up and populate the database:
     ```bash
     python populate_table.py
     ```

#### 5. **Import Data**
   - Run the script to fetch and format the data:
     ```bash
     python generate_db.py
     ```
   - This script will format the data and save it as `.json` files in the `populate_table` folder.

   - Populate the database with the JSON data:
     ```bash
     python populate_table.py
     ```

#### 6. **Run the Application**
   - You can start the application using the following command:
     ```bash
     flask run
     ```

### Currently Supported Features:
1. Problems: Users can create, view, and solve coding problems.
2. Problem Tags/Filtering: Problems can be categorized and filtered by tags like difficulty level.
3. Discussions: Users can engage in discussions and comment on problems.
4. Contests: Users can participate in time-bound contests and view rankings based on their scores.
5. User Roles and Permissions: Manage user access and permissions using roles.
6. Popup Resources: Users can access a curated list of valuable programming resources.
- Each feature belongs in its own model, controller, service and repository.

Supported Fancy features
1. Tasteful UI
2. JWT + Login (managing multiple users)
3. User Collaboration on CodeEditor (real-time) using Liveblocks 
4. Live code testing and submission with multi-language support using JudgeZero
5. Problem recommendation algorithm (query-based)


# Production Dataset
- The production dataset can be generated by running the python script **import_data** in the "setup" folder which generates json files for the prod data (you might not have to do them because there there is already preloaded prod data in the json).
- Run other python scripts in setup/populate_table folder that reads and loads table with the generated json file.
- For example, running the populate_popups.py file populates the PopupsResource database. Similarly, each script maps to a major table. Each script converts the below relevant dataset to json or csv format as you can see. After that, it connects to our database using the psycopg2 library and inserts the data from those files.
- These are the datasets we used
